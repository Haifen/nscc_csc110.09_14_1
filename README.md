###North Seattle Community College CSC 110 (Python) section 9 2014 Fall quarter class repository

Hello, Mr. Wu and fellow classmates:

This is my public repo for my schoolwork for NSCC's CSC 110.09 Fall 2014 course (item 2312).  Issues, forking, pull requests and any Wiki edits are permitted for anyone with a GitHub account.  Anyone who wishes to be added as a collaborator (commit access, etc) may request to be added as such, provided they can supply me with a GitHub username.

Given that it's more than likely I (and, at most, Mr. Wu) will be the only ones looking at this repository in any serious capacity, I have no need to have additional sets of eyes on the work I collect here.  I'm sure many of the little pieces of Python here could be generously called flawed, and I could indeed benefit from being informed of better ways to do things, but the likelihood that having n cooks in the kitchen will increase my productivity on even a linear scale is somewhat improbable.

Thank you for perusing this repo, and I hope if you do have a concern or comment that you will be forthcoming in sharing it with me.
