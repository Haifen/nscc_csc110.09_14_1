## Calculate linear dimensions required for construction work in a completely unexciting room (right prism) of order {|n| n <= 3} plus total unit cost of corresponding n-dimensionally-measured ({|n| n <= 3}) materials, based on individually specified linear dimensions (a tuple of three floating-point values, for three right axes).

#Sorry, Mr. Wu, but the hashbang takes precedence over a descriptive comment.
#Header format is a butchered derivative of Gentoo's (CVS', really) (too much verbosity about locale, unapologetic POSIX format of the datestring, literal TZ offset in case you couldn't work it out, NetID instead of standard simple UNIXy username (robink@northseattle.edu instead of robink ("robink according to who?", one might ask)), SVN-style revisions instead of (CV|RC)S' attempt to do major, minor and point version management) ebuild header format, typically used by developers (but also appropriated by users and unofficial developers for marking up ebuilds they have in personal overlays).  It is decidedly unoriginal, it may suck, but it will never change.
#P.S.: Everything is available on GitHub if you want to browse changes (I do commit changes to files over time, rather than just check in the finished version, you just don't usually see the set of changes that happen in a lab session, since I don't have easy access to Git and plink/OpenSSH on the lab machines).  The URLs are https://github.com/Haifen/nscc_csc110_201409 for the WebIF and SmartGit, git://github.com/Haifen/nscc_csc110_201409 for a fast checkout using any vintage Git client, and ssh://git@github.com/Haifen/nscc_csc110_201409 if you have a GitHub account and commit access to the repo.

The problem is making identity assignments that can't be as easily looked up via __next__ on something iterable which also uses the value of the parent key in the subkey is brain-damaged before you even get into the subject of the pitfalls of multiple equivalent identities in a hierarchy without any kind of qualifying indirection.  So, yeah, this is stupid, but I think it's being assigned in by reference, so yay for not completely wasting gobs of process space.

# Room's linear dimensions are stored as an array (it would, of course, be possible (although horrible and ugly) to slip three closures straight into a tuple definition/assignment and slap it down right then and there (yay immutability!), but despite the fact that tuples are subscriptable, and despite the fact that it's unlikely one would change a single linear value as opposed to the set (excepting the possibility that they may be interested in correcting a single error), and despite the fact that values as references are bad no matter which language camp you're from, being able to use the mental constant of x index = 0, y index = 1, etc is hopefully enough in this case (simple, but arguably not documentable).  Plus I've got a big ugly hash to help me out with the relationships if I get confused).

Were I really clever I'd be able to not only have a nice cubic relationship between the unit of paint and the linear dimensions of the room (one could assume the necessary paint could be expressed as the cube of the sum of the linear dimensions of the area, with some constant thrown in there before we take things to dimensions cubed, since you can envision coats of paint as barely 3-dimensional slabs of (un)dried paint matter), and also suss out the inverse relationship between how much paint you'll need to be semi-consistently n millimeters from the wall surface and the increase in the fractional dimension of the wall surface as it bends at 90ยบ at each corner, but holy heck, I'm nowhere near that schooled.", 72)))
